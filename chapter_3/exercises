Excersice 3.1:
    How much space would be required to store a table for an entire idealized 
    block cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks and that has 80-bit keys?

    The table will has 2^80 elements because the key size is 80 bits, each with 
    a size of 2^64 bits, each element is 64-bits because of the 64-bit block 
    size.
    
    This is 1.511 * 10^11 TiB.


Exersice 3.2:
    1. How many rounds are in DES?
    2. How many bits are in a DES key?
    3. What is the DES block size?
    4. How does 3DES work as a function of DES?

    1. There are 16 rounds in DES, each round uses a seperate 48-bit key which
    is called the round key. Each round key is formed by selecting 48-bits from
    the 56-bit key. The algorithm that is used to derive the round keys is 
    called the key scheduler.

    2. It uses a 56-bit key.

    3. The block size of DES is 64 bits, this makes it unsuitable for modern use.

    4. 3DES is three DES encryptions in sequence, It uses two or three different
    56-bit DES keys, first you encrypt with key 1, then you decrypt the
    ciphertext with key 2, and then you either encrypt the ciphertext with a 
    third key, or the first key again. This solves the problem with the limited
    key size of DES, but it does not solve the problem with the 64-bit block
    size.


Exercise 3.3:
    1. What are the possible lengths for AES keys?
    2. For each key length, how many rounds are in AES?
    3. What is the AES block size?

    1. AES is defined for 128-, 192-, and 256-bit keys.
    
    2. It uses 10-14 rounds depending on the keys, 10 rounds for 128-bit, 12 for
    192-bit, and 14 rounds for 256-bit. Like in DES there is a key scheduler
    that generates the keys for each round.

    3. Even tho AES supports different key sizes the block size is always 
    128-bit.


Exercise 3.4:
    1. Under what situations might you choose 3DES over AES?
    2. Under what situations might you choose AES over 3DES?

    1. Only when the system created talks with another system that requiers 3DES
    for compability, if the system is created from grounds up there is not any
    good reasons to choose 3DES over AES.

    2. AES would be choosen in any system that would be implemented today, and
    does not requiere to talk to another older system that only works with 3DES.


Exercise 3.5:
    1. Suppose you have a processor that can perform a single DES encryption or 
    decryption operation in 2^âˆ’26 seconds. Suppose you also have a large number
    of plaintext-ciphertext pairs for DES under a single, unknown key. How many
    hours would it take, on average, to find that DES key, using an exhaustive 
    search approach and a single processor?
    
    2. How many hours would it take, on average, to find that DES key, using an 
    exhaustive search approach and a collection of 2^14 processors?

    1. The DES keys are 56-bit, so there is 2^56 possible keys, you can do 2^26
    DES operations each second, so it will take 2^56/2^26 seconds to find the
    key. This turns out to be 34 years to find the key. 

    2. With 2^14 processors the search will be 2^56/(2^26*2^14) seconds, which
    is a little more than 18 hours.
